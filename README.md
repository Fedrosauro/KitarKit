### Project Group:

  - Emanuele Goat
  - Federico Pellizzaro
  - Giovanni Zanin

### Task:
> AI-based tool for supporting artists' creativity
>
> Example:
>
>    1) Generation of book or music album covers<br>
>    2) Book illustrations<br>
>    3) Songwriting<br>
>    ...<br>

### Solution proposed:
**For the specific case of guitarists**, a model has been trained to recognize *which effects have been applied to a guitar sound*. The **best accuracy** found on the test set was **~75%**. 

Due to the dataset limitations, the model in this repo can currently recognize just *one effect* applied to a guitar sound. However, the **CNN** has been **studied and developed** so that a model can be trained with a dataset where *multiple sound effects* are applied to a guitar sound.

Additionally, a small web app has been developed to showcase the model's response when given random guitar sounds sourced from the internet.
